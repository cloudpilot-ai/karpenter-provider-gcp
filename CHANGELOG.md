# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## Unreleased

### New features

- Added a garbage-collection controller (`instance.garbagecollection`) that periodically
  detects and deletes GCE VM instances with no corresponding NodeClaim, preventing orphaned
  instances from accumulating after missed deletes or controller restarts.
- Added `goog-k8s-cluster-location` GCE label to instances at creation time. The GC
  controller and the instance cache only operate on instances that carry this label, so
  they reliably scope to the correct cluster even when multiple clusters share the same name
  in different GCP locations.

### Migration guide

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the full upgrade steps, including rotating live nodes
to the new label scheme and cleaning up any pre-existing orphaned instances.

## v0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- `karpenter.k8s.gcp/instance-family` requirements now match the **machine type prefix** (the part before the first `-`), not the full family+shape.
  - **Before** (worked): `["n4-standard", "n2-standard"]`
  - **Now** (required): `["n4", "n2"]`
  - `e2` is unchanged (e.g. `e2-medium` still has family `e2`).

If you upgrade to v0.2.0 and Karpenter suddenly stops finding instance types, check any existing NodePools that constrain `karpenter.k8s.gcp/instance-family` and update values accordingly.

### Upgrade guide

Update any NodePool `requirements` that use `karpenter.k8s.gcp/instance-family` to use the prefix (e.g. `n4`, `n2`), not the combined family+shape (e.g. `n4-standard`, `n2-standard`).

Before:

```yaml
requirements:
  - key: "karpenter.k8s.gcp/instance-family"
    operator: In
    values: ["n4-standard", "n2-standard", "e2"]
```

After:

```yaml
requirements:
  - key: "karpenter.k8s.gcp/instance-family"
    operator: In
    values: ["n4", "n2", "e2"]
```
